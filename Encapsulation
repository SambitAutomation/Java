This is a OOPS concept of java which is containing DATA HIDING and ABSTRACTION.

DATA HIDING
-----------
In this whatever datatype we will be used all modifiers should define as "private".
By that we can get security features AND the ultimate meaning of this feature is not to see our code or datatype to any outsider


ABSTRACTION
-----------
In this we will hide the implementation from users. User is only allowed to access the setup services.
In this whatever menthod we will implement all will be for validation purpose.

ENCAPSULATON
------------
The combination of Data hiding and Abstraction is called Encapsulation which means grouping of data members and methods in single class.

For this we need two special user-defined method.
1.getter Method
2.setter Method

Example
------
public class parent
{
private String name;

public String getName()
{
return name;
}

public void setName(String newName)
{
this.name=newName;
}
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


public class test
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
person testObject=new person();
testObject.setName("Any String Value");
System.out.println(testObject.getName());
}
}
